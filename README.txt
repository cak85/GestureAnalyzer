Description:
------------
The development of new gestures for human-computer-interfaces is a challenging task. The requirements of great usability and easy access have to be fulfiled. This is a research application for capturing and analysis of finger gestures developed during a Master-Thesis-Project. The application enables realtime capturing, animation and analysis of finger gestures and finger motion. Capturing is based on a MARG-sensor dataglove. Recorded measurement data can be compared each other and gives easy access to aggregated information about a special data preparation and visualization.

The new research application is the groundwork for the development of new finger gestures which fulfil nominated requirements and afford an opportunity of faster and better development and evaluation.

This Eclipse-Java-Project contains the main desktop application.
